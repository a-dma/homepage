Hi, I'm Alessio.

Since 2014 I have been employed at [[https://www.yubico.com/][Yubico]], where I work on strong
multi-factor authentication, smart cards (FIDO 2, OpenPGP, PIV),
YubiKey and YubiHSM.

In 2014 I received a PhD in Computer Science from the Embedded System
Engineering section of the Department of Applied Mathematics and
Computer Science at the [[https://www.dtu.dk/][Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU). My
research focus was on Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks, with
particular attention to Security.
